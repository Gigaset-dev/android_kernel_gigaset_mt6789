	  Unified GPAPI that support multiple TEE implementations and select one dynamically.
	  Originally, each TEE ko will export one set of GPAPI, and TEE clients (CA) only can
	  link one set at building time. This middle-layer will export GP api for client use,
	  and invoke real GP api by function pointer which registered by each TEE ko.
	  This will remove export GPAPI in each TEE ko implemented by vendors.

	  This is a test module that test each GP API of gpapi_coorinator if can work rightly.
	  It connects with tee_sanity TA and utilize existed test cases. So must enable one TEE
	  by dts and enable tee_sanity TA and t-driver.
	  To assure gpapi_coordinator work rightly with every TEE implementation, it better to
	  enable TEE implementation by dts one by one.
